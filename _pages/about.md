Dawdle was created August 5th, 2018, with the purpose to have a home for people. Our goal is to cultivate friendships and create a community in which love and wholesomeness can thrive. We always encourage kindness, even towards those that might not show us the same courtesy. We always want people to feel loved and cared about. We discourage edgy memes and dark humor, and we also discourage self deprecating jokes, as being kind to everyone in the server includes being kind to yourself.

Ultimately, the way things are run and the rules we have were formed in order to keep the wonderful community that has been built. Dawdle has been as successful and as active as it is because of its members! Without those that want to spread kindness, there would be no Dawdle. This is why we require everyone to be welcoming, because cliques are what encourage exclusivity, and our purpose is to be inclusive and to provide a home to all.

We themed the server around Kirby, which is why a lot of our store items, emojis, server icons, and server banners are of him. We also love cute colors, minimal channels, and minimal roles to avoid clutter. Our bot Dawdlebot was created by @amer with the purpose to facilitate how Dawdle is run.

This entire server would not be thriving if not for the wonderful staff team that keeps things in order. We appreciate every single one of you that help the community be as wonderful as it is, and we hope to continue spreading love and joy!

Much love,

Saint
